# Idealized UCLA-ROMS Simulation Generator

`NewExp_Neptune.m` is a MATLAB script that generates all necessary configuration and input files to run an idealized UCLA-ROMS simulation.

## Cluster Configuration

The cluster-related files generated by `NewExp_Neptune.m` are tailored for the [Expanse cluster](https://www.sdsc.edu/systems/expanse/user_guide.html) at UC San Diego (UCSD).

Obtaining computational hours on Expanse is relatively straightforward by applying through the [ACCESS program](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).
